### Volunteer Network Application

Volunteer Network was created with the plan to continue extending features to cover volunteer opportunities throughout the US. 
At this time, the volunteer opportunities are based off of a proximity to Denver, Colorado. 
Other well known volunteer sites seemed quite difficult to work around organizing a volunteer event as an individual, so this would make that option much easier to achieve.

### Technologies: 

The technologies used for this project are React & react routing for the client, and Ruby on Rails for the backend. Postgresql is used for the database. This application made use of Create, Read, Update Delete [CRUD] actions, as well as sessions and user authentication. Originally, styling was done through CSS - But I have been working on the next iteration of this project and using MUI library to create a more sleek design as well as scaling to support adding and viewing locations all over the US. 


### What does this application do? 

The Volunteer Network application allows users to signup for an account, once signed in they can browse upcoming volunteer opportunities, signup for an opportunity, view their profile which shows their upcoming commitments, as well as organize a volunteer opportunity. Organizing an opportunity was the inspiration for building this app - to make it easier to have a one spot shop to have like minded individuals logging in ready to volunteer their time and making it easier for people to share their ideas.
